# ARM-Processor-Zed-board
### Examples with ARM assembly and C code using Zynq-7000 in Zed board

## Hardware
Zedboard (http://www.zedboard.org/)

## Language
ARM assembly & C code

## Environment
- Xilinx Vivado and SDK tools (v19.1) (www.xilinx.com)
- Tera Term (For UART communication)

## Description
`Mini-Project`
- Mini-OS(Operating System) with round-robin scheduler
for three applications

`Assignment#2`
- Program that sorts data in ascending order from the smallest to the largest

`Assignment#3`
- Program that turns on one LED at a time, starting from LED0 to LED7 and wrapping around with switches that determine duration

`Assignment#4`
- Assignment#3 with input source via UART(Tera Term)

`Assignment#5`
- Debugging macro in ARM assembly which prints out all the registers (R0~R15) and CPSR of the current mode to the UART terminal (Tera Term)

`Assignment#6`
- Digital watch using the private timer

`Assignment#7`
- Digital watch using interrupt from the private timer

`Assignment#8`
- Checking cache's impact on performance with LED blinking interval
